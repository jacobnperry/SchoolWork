    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The problem presented was to create an interest calculator that allowed for user input on how much they wanted to invest, how much monthly they wanted to invest, and interest.  Once the user entered this information they have displayed a table of how much their investment would grow based on the information entered.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I feel that through this project I had modularity as a very important component when building the app.  I wanted to allow the user multiple opportunities to see their investment outlook and have multiple opportunities to change the data they are providing.  Additionally, it was important to create the classes in a way that could be used multiple times throughout the project to avoid redundant code.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I believe that some of the algorithms could have been condensed and the classes could use more refinement to remove unneeded functions.
    
    Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I had a challenging time setting up the classes to have it all interact with one another the way I was anticipating.  Thankfully though many google searches and digging through StackOverflow questions I was able to get the functionality I was aiming for.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    Modularity is the #1 component that I took away from this project, building the code in a way that maximizes the ability to reuse blocks of code instead of creating multiple unique functions that serve similar purposes.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I attempting to make this as program as agile as I could by utilizing base classes with shared variables and primary loop to allow the user to enter in check multiple variables without having to create unique variables for each occurrence.
